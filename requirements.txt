flask==1.1.2  # An older version of Flask, likely has known vulnerabilities
requests==2.25.0 # Another older version, good for testing
numpy==1.20.0

django>=3.0,<4.0
pandas~=1.1

# A package that likely has no vulnerabilities listed on OSV.dev
# (using a more recent version of a well-maintained library)
# For example, a recent version of a utility library
# python-dateutil==2.8.2 
# Actually, let's use a very specific, less common one for a "None Found" test
# if it's not in OSV.dev or has no listed vulns for the specific version
tinyrecord==0.2.0

# A package with a more complex specifier
# Werkzeug!=2.0.0,>=1.0.1
werkzeug>=1.0.1,!=2.0.0 # Our current regex might just pick up the first part or treat as range

# A package that might not exist or has a typo (to test error handling from requests.get or OSV)
# nonexistantpackage==1.0.0 
# (Commented out as this would break a real `pip install -r requirements.txt`)
# For GAIOS, if a package isn't found by OSV, it should just say "None Found" or similar.
